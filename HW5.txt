In this assignment, you will write a simple python script to classify images into blurry/ not blurry using FT.
The idea being that blurry images have non-sharp edges/fine details, and that will be reflected in the frequency 
domain as low energy in the high frequency components, compared to the energy in the same components for the sharp (non-blurry) images.


Remove the low frequency part (set it to zero) and then calculate the energy in the remaining high frequency elements.
If the energy is greater than a specific threshold, the image is not blurry. Otherwise it is blurry. 
Use provided images for testing. 
Sample_res.png shows a sample result for one blurry image  and one not-blurry image.
